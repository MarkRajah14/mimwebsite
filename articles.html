            <h3 style="text-align: center;">"The Media and COVID-19"</h3>
            <h4 style="text-align: center;">Written By: Alessandra de Dios</h4>

                It is no lie COVID-19 has impacted millions of people: The young and the old, the poor and the rich, the colored and the uncolored could not escape the tragic mental and physical effects of the pandemic. In the early days of the pandemic in the United States, the CDC recommended people to quarantine at home to combat the spread of the disease. Along with this instruction, came public retaliation from those advocating their “freedom” over their health and safety. In fact, according to a study, young people are more likely to vocalize their concerns about COVID-19 than older people. <br>
                <br>
                With the increasingly popular use of social media, especially among young people, opinions can be expressed and conversations can be sparked about a variety of controversial topics. Gen-Z (1997-2013) in particular, utilizes the media to spread awareness and communicate their thoughts. For example, the rise of TikTok allowed for young people to find entertainment during these challenging and often monotonous times. Social media brings young people together to relate to each other even with social distancing guidelines. This sense of being able to be understood embodies the characteristic of all "Gen-Zers" of wanting to be identified with. <br>
                <br>
                Not only is the media used to share COVID-19 memes, but also inaccurate precautions that institute a dangerous faction in society. Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook and owner of other social media platforms, has faced criticism for misinformation over COVID-19 vaccines. Many people have become wary over the possible effects of vaccines and have even earned themselves the title of an “anti-vaxxer.” These so-called “anti-vaxxers” emphasize the possible side effects rather than the benefits. About 99% of COVID related deaths in June 2021 were unvaccinated individuals according to Dr. Anthony Fauci. This statistic further proves that vaccines are vital in defeating the deadly COVID-19 disease. In essence, there is a dark side of the media that people should take into consideration regarding their personal views. For now, let’s continue to enjoy memes on Twitter and TikTok. <br>

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">"Advocating for Adolescent Mental Health Awareness"</h3>
            <h4 style="text-align: center;">Written By: Suhani Gupta</h4>
            <p>
                It’s important to note that mental health is a serious matter that needs to be addressed, especially in adolescence. This is due to how the teenage years of an individual’s life can shape the rest of their future - including their personality, their work ethic, their ability to communicate, etc. Poor mental health can lead to multiple issues that include depression, suicidal tendencies, eating disorders. These problems can break an adult - imagine the effect they could have on teenagers. While most people mistake adolescent mental health to be a simple matter of going through puberty and adjusting to a new school, the situation behind it tends to be harsher than what it is made to be. The reality is that as teenagers continue to move through life, obstacles are thrown towards them, one of the major ones being the matter of peers and educational surroundings. <br>
                <br>
                A study conducted in 2019 by the CDC shows that ⅓ of high school students have felt feelings of sadness and hopelessness - a scary 40% increase from the last study, which was conducted in 2009, almost ten years ago. Mental health battles also seem to target LGBTQ+ teens, almost ½ of which considered suicide. It also seems to follow BIPOC, as the number of attempted suicides by black students rose by almost 50%. Students tend to face an enormous amount of stress, ranging from a plethora of possibilities. Whether it could be attempting to assure an acceptance into a prestigious college or trying to reveal your identity to your friends and family, the amount of stress that someone undergoes can truly get under their skin. <br>
                <br>
                As this issue begins to get addressed, there are a lot of things that can help a student in need. Schools can try to build supportive environments and try to encourage positive mental health instead of shunning it away. Advocating for mental health can help a student feel safe and loved. Parents and families can encourage students to open up and share their voices, as well as making sure to communicate with them as much as possible. Knowing that they have a safe outlet to let go of what has been troubling them can be a big factor in helping make a teenager feel better. As the world begins to acknowledge just how important mental health is, together, everyone can work together to ensure that teenagers can enjoy their golden years healthily and happily. If someone you know is struggling with any sort of mental health issues, please encourage them to be honest with you and support them in any way that you can. If you are struggling yourself, please be open with your family and friends - they are here to help. <br>

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">"Eating Disorders See No Color"</h3>
            <h4 style="text-align: center;">Written By: Karina Chabra</h4>
            <p>
                Traditionally, eating disorders have been stereotyped as illnesses that only affect young, affluent Caucasian women. However, eating disorders do not discriminate, as they affect people of all ages, genders, socioeconomic status, nationality, culture, and race. About 24 million people suffer from an eating disorder in the United States, according to the American Society for Nutrition. Society plays a significant role in influencing individuals, including adolescents. Advertisements and social media, as well as one's environment and surroundings have the power to impact young minds, especially in terms of body image. For example, in South Asian communities, it is common for family members or friends to comment on the life, behavior, or even physical appearance of many. Being thin and having a fair complexion are characteristics that are considered “attractive.” As a result, South Asians tend to face a variety of societal pressures that convince them to go to extremes in an attempt to meet this ideal, which can often lead to adopting disordered eating patterns. Aside from genetic predisposition and neurobiology, the constant emphasis on body shape and weight, as well as the level of perfectionism among driven Asian Americans, are essential predictors of the possible development of disordered eating habits. <br>
                <br>
                Additionally, various studies have shown that Latinas have eating disorders and concerns about body image equal to or greater than Non-Latina whites. Researchers have also found among adolescents that Hispanics were significantly more likely to suffer from bulimia nervosa than their non-Hispanic counterparts. According to a study, Latinas were most likely to report desiring a weight lower than their current weight, to consider themselves as being overweight, and to present low body satisfaction, in a sample of adolescent girls attending public middle schools and high schools. Latinas are frequently fed conflicting messages and cultural expectations regarding body shape and weight. In both Hispanic and South Asian cultures, food is closely connected with family life. At large gatherings, one is expected to enjoy food with relatives, while also being reminded by the Western World that thinness equates to beauty. <br>
                <br>
                Eating disorders are societal issues and psychiatric illnesses that show no bias. Many people of color face obstacles and barriers to seeking treatment. In terms of Asian Americans, the lack of communication and acknowledgement of mental illness gets in the way of accessing care. Misconceptions and stereotypes surrounding mental illness, causes it to be overlooked in communities that do not see psychological health as a priority. Similarly, the stigma of mental health treatment is one factor of what prevents many Latinas from receiving treatment. Because of this stigma, the majority of people are unaware that half of the American population personally knows someone with an eating disorder, and that it has the highest mortality rate of all mental illnesses. Recovery and healing come after acknowledging the issue, overcoming the stereotypes, and abandoning the denial of an affliction. <br>
